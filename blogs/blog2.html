      <h1>First Book I Read!</h1>
      <p>
        Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book on finance. A great book if you are new to
        the world of finance. In the book Robert Kiyosaki(author of the book)
        share his experience of his two dads. His poor dad who worked for money,
        was educated but struggled with money. On the other hand his friend dad
        who he called his Rich dad whose money worked for him, wasn’t educated
        but still rich. <br /><br />
        Here are my top 3 learning from the book. <br /><br />
        1. Don’t work for money, make money work for you. Robert talks about how
        his poor dad worked for money where as his rich dad made money work for
        him. He always believe in paying himself first i.e putting his money to
        work where it will grow. On the other hand his poor dad spend most of
        his salary repaying his debt and other bills. <br /><br />
        2. Understanding Asset and Liabilities On the theoretical level
        understanding asset and liabilities is very different from knowing how
        to actually use the concept. In the book, author explained Asset is
        anything that put money into your pocket (like stocks, bonds, real
        estates) and liabilities as anything that take money out from your
        pocket (like debt/loans) which is a great and simple way for layman to
        understand such financial concepts. To get rich one should try to
        increase the asset and decrease the liabilities from his/her life.
        <br /><br />
        3. Most people act based upon emotion mainly fear or greed. People are
        emotional creatures. They work based on emotions. When it comes to the
        equity market, people operated on two emotions i.e fear and greed . When
        the market in the boom phase, people get greedy and put everything in
        the stock market and it the exact moment where smart investor take out
        their money and make all the profit. On the other hand at the time of
        bust, people the fearful. Helping smart investor to buy at discounted
        prices.
