      <h1>How to win Friend and influence people</h1>
      <p>
        How to win Friend and influence people is a book of social dynamics.
        Dale Carnegie has compiled his best advices from his work and study of
        people about how to make people like you and be unforgettable.
        <br /><br />
        Here our top 5 Lessons from the books. <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">
          Lesson 1 Don't complain, everyone is right in their minds:-</span
        >
        <br />
        Nobody thinks they are stupid. Everyone is right in their own mind so by
        complaining and making them feel that they are wrong you will get what
        you want. Instead make the complain sound like an advice or suggestion
        instead being direct on the face.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">
          Lesson 2 People want to feel important anyway.</span
        >
        <br />Compliments always work. Everyone wants to feel good about
        themselves. All of us are insecure about something and lil bit of
        appreciation goes a long way, making the other person feel they are
        important. <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">
          Lesson 3 Everyone is interested in themselves so for them to like you,
          you should be interested in them.</span
        ><br />
        Most of us like to talk about ourselves when given the right and
        comfortable environment. Be that person who is a good listener or
        atleast be interested to know about the other person. It will
        significantly increase you likability for the other person.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">
          Lesson 4 Smile, yes it is obvious but we forget.</span
        ><br />
        You can never ignore a nice smile. It is in human to mirror others
        emotions. So Yes SMILE more! <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Lesson 5 Remember the name</span> <br />Our name is
        one of our favorite words for our ears. It is a great attention grabbing
        technique, always remember peopleâ€™s name.
